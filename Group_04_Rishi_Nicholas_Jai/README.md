## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/space_debris_gripper.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/constellation_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/debris_capture_controller.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/space_debris_capture_benchmark.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
