## 1. Authorized Research Title & Problem Statement

> "How can a vision-based mobile companion robot in MuJoCo integrate MediaPipe fall-detection kinematics to reduce emergency dispatch latency within the critical 6-minute cardiac arrest survival window for elderly individuals living alone?"

### Core Engineering Focus
* **Physics & Kinematics:** Google DeepMind MuJoCo multi-body dynamic physics simulation (`models/elderly_companion_base.xml`).
* **Autonomous Control:** Closed-loop Python control architecture with student implementation boundaries (`src/fall_detection_kinematics.py`).
* **Technoeconomic Evaluation:** Dimensionless CSBS operational economics and return on investment model (`analytics/geriatric_care_economics.py`).
* **Empirical Validation:** Reproducible benchmark trials and statistical hypothesis testing (`analytics/fall_triage_benchmark.csv`).

> [!NOTE]
> ### The Devil's Advocate: Reality Check & Theoretical Roast
> *"An autonomous mobile companion equipped with pan-tilt MediaPipe vision to detect sudden falls within the 6-minute golden window, which will inevitably trigger a code-red 911 emergency dispatch because grandpa dropped his TV remote and decided to take an afternoon nap on the living room rug."*

## 5. Pedagogical Boundaries: Guidance vs Student Ownership

To ensure academic rigor and authentic student learning, this repository enforces strict boundaries between scaffolding and student deliverables:

* **Provided by Course Scaffolding:**
  * Validated physical model architecture in MuJoCo MJCF (`models/elderly_companion_base.xml`).
  * Verification toolchain and smoke test script (`src/test_env.py`).
  * Literature foundation, mathematical formulations, and conference paper blueprint (`docs/`).
  * Dimensionless technoeconomic framework (`analytics/geriatric_care_economics.py`).
* **Student Technical Deliverables (Required for Evaluation):**
  * Implement and tune the control algorithm in `src/fall_detection_kinematics.py` (filling all marked `# TODO [Student Roll / Name]` blocks).
  * Run physics simulation trials to collect and expand empirical data in `analytics/fall_triage_benchmark.csv`.
  * Re-run `analytics/generate_paper_figures.py` to regenerate publication figures with live experimental telemetry.
  * Author the final 4-page IEEE conference paper in `docs/RESEARCH_PAPER_MANUSCRIPT_BLUEPRINT.md` and defend individual Git commits during the oral viva.
